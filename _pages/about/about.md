# Hello there!

![A picture of me](/public/img/me.jpg)

My name is Chris.

I'm a software engineer and I like to build stuff that work.

My main interest is computer science and more specifically
compilers, which I pursue in various ways. In addition to that, I also care
about the practice of programming and programming languages and tools.

Moreover, I enjoy running, travelling, cooking, watching movies and reading
books about sci-fi, history, philosophy and not only.

This blog is going to be a potpourri of the above. Add it to your feed.
